TideSDK Developer
=======

This is a revived version of Appcelerator's [Titanium Developer](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_developer), continued from Adriano's [TiDev Community](https://github.com/adrianopaladini/titanium_developer) fork from 2011.

It is being updated to work with the latest TideSDK releases, and without the long gone Appcelerator Cloud services.

To install, download this source, import it to TideSDK Developer, and launch it like any other TideSDK application.

To build and run TideSDK Developer from the command line:

	python "path-to-TideSDK-sdk/tidebuilder.py" . -r
